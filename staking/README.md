# Staking

## What is staking?

Staking is the act of holding your tokens or coins to get assets in return as a reward and/or strengthen the network (essentially passive income). We will only discuss holding tokens to get tokens as rewards in return. There are various ways one can stake, two examples being:

* Non-liquidity staking;
* Liquidity staking;

Staking tokens, rather than coins, is usually an **incentive** to hold that specific token as opposed to strengthening a network. This is usually done by rewarding stakers with said token. Our contract uses the non-liquidity staking \(or **single staking**\) method, which means you only have to stake $XYA in order to get $XYA as a reward (eliminating impermanent loss as well).

The higher the amount of $XYA you stake, the higher the rewards you receive based on the same algorithm. The rewards are distributed on-chain, which means the process of earning these rewards is completely automatic; all you have to do is to stake your tokens. The [\(verified\)](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x861ef0cab3ab4a1372e7eda936668c8967f70110?activeTab=6) contract deployed on Harmony holds all the pledged tokens and staking users, distributing rewards on a daily basis.
