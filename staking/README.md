# Staking

## What is staking?

Staking is the term any would use to denote the act of holding your tokens or coins, to get assets in return as reward or strengthen the network. We will only discuss holding tokens, to get tokens as reward in return. There are various ways one can stake, two examples are:

* Non-liquidity staking;
* Liquidity staking;

Staking tokens, rather than coins, are usually an **incentive** to hold that specific token rather than strengthening a network. These are incentivized by giving a certain token as reward. Our contract uses the non-liquidity staking \(or **single staking**\) method, this means you only have to stake $XYA in order to get $XYA as a reward.

The higher the amount of $XYA you stake, the higher the rewards are you receive - based on the same algorithm. The rewards are distributed on-chain, which means the process of earning these rewards is completely automatic. All you have to do is to stake them. The [\(verified\)](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x861ef0cab3ab4a1372e7eda936668c8967f70110?activeTab=6) contract deployed on Harmony holds all the pledged tokens, holds all the staking users and distributes all the rewards.
