                <br>
                <p>
                  Led by Regent Carroway of the monarch, the settlers spent countless years exploring the world of
                  GameFi Crossing, before finding the perfect location to call their home. The Freyfolk lived in peace and grew
                  their civilization. After a mining excavation by Payne’s Crew, they uncovered a mystical ore unlike
                  anything else. The regent named these crystals ‘XYA’ and this was the very beginning.

                <p>
                  The monarch soon realized that XYA was a volatile resource. Devising a way to determine the crystals’
                  stability, they could now observe its current state, as they tried to understand the true power of
                  this mystical ore. This was shown through a ‘Stability Meter’, which updated on regular intervals and
                  could even be used on other resources.

                <p>
                  Regent Carroway desired to continue collecting and studying in the hopes of gaining insurmountable
                  power. With rumors about XYA spreading, the Freyfolk soon divided themselves into two rivalrous clans.
                  The former believed that XYA could be used to create an indescribable utopia with power and advanced
                  technology, whilst the others considered XYA a dangerous weapon that needed to be eradicated.

                  Depositories for XYA soon were built within the monarch’s castle. Approved by users of the magical
                  arts, Regent Carroway planned to store and use extracted XYA for his own benefit. Villagers also began
                  creating their own small depositories, built in hidden basements and rooms, as smuggling around the
                  ore was highly prohibited.

                <p>
                  After careful planning, Regent Carroway enlisted the help of trusted servants and miners to extract
                  XYA from the mines ‒ much to one of the faction’s disapproval. Illegal extraction operations also
                  emerged, but only for the right price. The monarch’s stash of XYA slowly grew with each passing day,
                  and the regent felt prepared for any conflict that would arise.

                  Regent Carroway officially appointed Sir Reginald his butler, who had served the Carroway family for
                  his entire lifetime. Carroway entrusted his loyal butler with all his secrets, handing him the keys to
                  the kingdom of GameFi Crossing.

                  Regent Carroway was determined to start a new era of power and domination for the Freyfolk. Noticing the
                  natural power emanating from the world of GameFi Crossing, the regent decided that XYA was the key to
                  understanding these unknown forces and obtaining balance. The settlement was rebuilt and reborn, as the
                  Freyfolk integrated these crystals into their machines, structures and everyday lives.

                  Opportunists and bandits alike sought out to grow their stashes of XYA, relishing in the power and
                  chaos. Those that wanted this done quickly resulted in wagers and duels ‒ often to the death. High stake
                  games like these were often done in secrecy, away from any involvement from the monarch. An underground
                  corporation named ‘Luderion’ was formed to host these games in secrecy.

                <p>
                  To incentivize the Freyfolk to embrace the power of XYA, Regent Carroway allowed the public to enter a
                  democratic committee. People who held XYA openly were allowed to join this group, then discuss with
                  other committee members and vote for certain proposals. Those with more XYA were deemed worthier in the
                  regent’s eyes, with their opinion being more valuable.

                  Reginald handsomely, with him even offering his private services for XYA extraction.

                Word of Luderion soon began spreading amongst the Freyfolk. New wagers, with ten times the danger and
                rewards, were being initiated. Growing in riches, some wealthy participants would even bid other
                valuable and lucrative items. Despite Regent Carroway’s best attempts to uncover this scheme, the

                Some Freyfolk contacted Sir Reginald directly, allowing him to voice their opinions and advocate for

                The civilians of GameFi Crossing soon discovered the existence of Harmons, wild creatures that had roamed the
                earth for thousands of years. Regent Carroway ordered the immediate capture of any Harmon on sight and
                wanted to fully harness their power. Some members of the Freyfolk decided to covertly harvest their own
                Harmons, keeping them hidden away from the monarch using them for underground battles.

                proceedings of the Freyfolk community. More parties would contact Reginald privately for their own

                Luderion saw the newly attractive Harmons as an opportunity. Forming their own covert marketplace,
                Freyfolk members were able to barter their elemental creatures, purchasing and selling Harmons for items
